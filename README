A simple tic-tac-toe demo implemented using SignalR.  This is a sample I put together to give me a chance to tinker
with SignalR and to attempt to do TDD.  Any suggestions on improvement are very welcome.

The web project is configured to use IIS Express.  The default timeout setting doesn't seem to have any effect when
testing against WebDev.
